# Custom Scripts Repository
This is a public scripts repository for Ayehu users to share their content.

We invite you to use the custom scripts, modify them to suit your needs, get involved in the community, and then contribute back whatever new scripts you develop so that others can enjoy and learn from your hard work and build upon it to enhance it even further.

## What are Scripts?
The custom scripts in this repository are programs written in languages like Python, Perl, PowerShell, etc. to add functionality to the Ayehu NG platform.  They assist in management or usage of the platform and can be anything that makes administration simpler and more efficient.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome and appreciated! For instructions about adding/modifying scripts please see our [Custom Scripts Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
